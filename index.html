                            <p>
                                My name is Charlie Parsons.  It's nice to meet you!  I am a recent web development bootcamp grad from University of Denver.  I live in Denver with my wife and pets, and absolutely love living in Colorado.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before beginning this journey into web development, I worked in the craft beer inudstry here in Denver for about seven years.  I started out in the tap room and worked my way through bottling, kegging, and then finally brewing.  I loved it and it provided me with wonderful experiences and opportunities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I'm very much looking forward to transitioning careers and utilizing my newfound skills.  The bootcamp taught me how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as how to use MySQL, MongoDB, Express, React and NodeJS.  In homework and projects I have also started to look into some of the AWS tools, as well as some different kinds of authentication protocols.  Pop on over to my portfolio to check out some of the things I've created!
